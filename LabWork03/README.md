# Some Basic Transformation on The Image
## Emboss
The image is first grayscaled, and then embossed.

## Color Convert
An RGB color is represented as a point in a three-dimensional space, and we can do space transformation (that is, multiply a three-dimensional matrix) for a point in the three-dimensional space. Through space transformation, one color becomes another color (need to do some normalization and denormalization).

## Edge Extraction
Edges are detected using Sobel filters.
